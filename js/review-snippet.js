    text: "I hired High Tide to pressure wash my entire house exterior, the surrounding concrete, and also to clean our windows. They had fair and competitive pricing, but most of all they were extremely professional, responsive  with communication, they showed up on time and they did a great job. Everything you can ask for in a  reliable contractor. My windows and screens look amazing and the concrete that I donâ€™t think had been cleaned in 20 years came out like new. I highly recommend this company."
